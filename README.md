# CS110L: Safety in Systems Programming

# Description

Stanford CS110L is a course about Rust Language and Systems Programming. [<u>TODO</u>] There will be a list of "what I learned" when I finished the course.

# Resources

Most resources of this course are incomplete. I'll mainly focus on the Spring 2020 version, which is relatively aggregated. I also notice the content of this course is gradually decreasing across the years, thus maybe the course in 2022 is mostly refined.

# Progress

I have learned the basics of Rust with [Too Many Linked List](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/). In this course, I want to achieve two goals.

1. Review Rust to gain a deeper understanding.
2. Focus on concurrency in the latter part of the course.

To achieve these goals, I hope to complete the course in 1 week.
